Using Anaconda to look at student data at different schools.

## Overview of the School District Analysis
---
The purpose of this analysis was to provide the school board and superintendent with an analysis of different schools to provide insight into budgeting and spending among the schools. To do this, I analyzed school data and funding as well as student test scores in both math and reading for all grades. By conducting this analysis, I attempted to identify trends within the data that could be useful to the school board.

When I removed the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School I was able to identify changes in this dataframe.

As we can see from the images above, when we remove the scores from Thomas High, the Average Reading Score, Average Math Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing all goes down significantly.
